LUNA: {L}ightweight {U}nstructured {N}avier-Stokes {A}nalysis

Author: Isaiah Helt (ihelt3@gatech.edu)

LUNA is a CFD codebase intended to simulate basic 2D, and eventually 3D, viscous fluid flow. 
The mesh format used is su2 for it's simple ASCII formatting and export availability in GUI meshing tools like GMSH.
This project is largely a personal project to better understand CFD concepts and fluid physics, with a specific emphasis on turbulence.
