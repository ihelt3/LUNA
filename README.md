LUNA: {L}ightweight {U}nstructured {N}avier-Stokes {A}nalysis

Author: Isaiah Helt (ihelt3@gatech.edu)

LUNA is a CFD codebase intended to simulate 2D viscous fluid flow on an unstructured grid. 
The mesh format used is su2 for it's simple ASCII formatting and export availability in GUI meshing tools like GMSH.
This project is largely a personal project to better understand CFD concepts and fluid physics, with a specific emphasis on turbulence and chemistry modeling.
